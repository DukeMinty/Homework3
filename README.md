This code creates an inventory management system that uses classes and methods to iterate through a csv file to read the file data, parse the data into instances of product objects, and then updates the inventory to then be outputted. The way which this is done is through using inheritance and methods to relate classes and create methods to read the file data, parse it, and update inventory. The way at which to run the program is using the methods in the main file to filter or update inventory and then output the information. Dependencies of this code include the method to iterate and split the csv file while also having the csv file being properly formatted and completed to run. More dependencies include the StockManagerSingleton file that iterates, updates, and outputs the file, also with the initialize stock method that iterates the file which allows for other methods to be used.
